## Introduction

  The basic purpose of this application is to transferring image/audio from one device to another using the SMS technique. Basically, it will be used for sending an image/audio to a remote location through a chunk of SMS in offline mode (Without using the internet). So that the primary goal of this App is to facilitate the under-developed area with no internet or poor internet connection 3G/LTE/4G signal and another who can’t afford a data bundle can share image/audio.

The application handles all the operations and SMS which relate to this App and convert them into image/audio.
## Purpose of this Project
   At present, if we want to transmit the image and audio to the remote location, we can send only over the internet. If we load image and audio in SMS App it will be converted into MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services), which it sends through a good internet connection. MMS is not a good idea because of an under-developed area with no internet or poor internet connection 3G/LTE/4G signal and another who can’t afford a data bundle. However, due to this product, they should be capable of sharing their cherished memories and memorable moments, using standard SMS without internet packages. SMS packages are easily affordable for everyone.
The second issue is that the sender and receiver must have a good internet connection to send or receive the image and audio. Internet packages are very expensive. So, everyone cannot afford, and they worry about their internet bills. However, due to this product, they should be capable of transmitting their image and audio in offline mode through SMS. In this product,just one-sided (sender side) SMS package is required. 

Another issue is that data security issues which face every user. So now, in this system, we provide security for users according to their requirement. Now, no one would be capable of checking the image/audio else sender/receiver.

Now-a-days, everyone is using SMS in a tremendous way of communicating with each other,as mobile communication has become the most basic means of communication. SMS is an integral part of data communication between mobile phones. However, sometimes, we need to send an image to someone else. There are means of communication that cater to this need, but all of them require internet. So now, in this system, we introduce SMS technology to transmit image/audio to a remote location.
